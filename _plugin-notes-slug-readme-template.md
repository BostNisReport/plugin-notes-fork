### Development Status:

> **Status Options:** Needs Testing (purple #E9E2F8) / Testing in Progress (orange #F9E8E6) / Needs Debugging (red #F9E6F4) / Needs Development (yellow #F9F0E6) / Needs Configuration (yellow-green #F9F7E6) / Development-Only (grey #D7DADD) / Satisfactory As Supplied (light-green #F0F8E2) / Development Complete (green #EBF9E6) / Documentation Requested (light-blue #EAF2FA) / Developer Review Requested (dark-blue #E6F9F9)

> I suggest that **only** this first line be set by the implementors first - with a suitable matching colour-code. This gives a fast way to communicate with everyone the potential attention needs from developers for further reading or not.

> Then, if a developer needs further information, they can change the status to "Documentation Requested" to indicate to implementors that need - and implementors can set to "Developer Review Requested" when they have documented and now require a developer to review or complete further work with links to tickets.
